Hubzilla MusiCloud Module
================================

A plugin and module to provide access to cloud folders through music player APIs (currently focused on the Ampache API).

This is intended to access music libraries with mobile music players compatible to ampache without installing a dedicated ampache server. Should provide full integrated music service for hubzilla community service.
